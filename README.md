# VGameShop
This is the final project for the Web Application Development course at IES Laguna de Joatzel, Getafe, Madrid.

Developed by:
- Daniel Rodríguez Muñoz
- Marina Guanghua Pintado Guerrero

The project consists of a ficticious game store, on which users can log in, search for games, add them to their wishlists, "buy" them, add them to their libraries and (possibly) download files.

There are other users (administrators) that can create games, adding their title, description, developer, publisher, release date, images to showcase and a file that will be the one that users download after "buying" the game.
